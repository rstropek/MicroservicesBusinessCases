# SmartHomeTech: A Microservices Tale

## Company History

### Founding and Early Success

*SmartHomeTech* was established five years ago by two tech enthusiasts with a penchant for innovation. Recognizing the potential of smart homes, they developed a groundbreaking software platform. They utilized a microservices architecture, harnessing a mix of technologies like

- Go and Nodejs (for backend services),
- Python (for data science and machine learning) and 
- React (for frontend development),

ensuring that they employed the best tools suited for each task. This strategic decision played a pivotal role in the success of their software, placing *SmartHomeTech* at the pinnacle of the IoT smart home market. 

The founders also took an innovative approach to state management and data storage. Depending on the specific requirements of each microservice, they adeptly chose between SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (Mongodb, Redis) databases, leveraging the strengths of both, always opting for open-source solutions to ensure flexibility and community support.

Being ahead of their time, they decided to provide the software as a 100% SaaS (Software as a Service). This was hosted on Kubernetes clusters that *SmartHomeTech* managed on their own, with the servers housed in a sizable local data center.

### Acquisition and Change in Leadership

A year ago, an investor, seeing the potential of *SmartHomeTech*, acquired the company. This transition led to the departure of the two original founders and five core engineers. New professionals were brought on board to take the reins of the company's technical operations.

After its acquisition and the departure of its original members, the company went through a restructuring process. They currently have a team of 20 employees. Below is a breakdown of their organization structure:

- Executive Management (2 members)
- Engineering Team (9 members; responsible for development and system operations)
- Product Team (3 members; oversees the product's lifecycle, from conception to release, and ensures it aligns with market needs)
- Support Engineers (2 members; provide technical support to customers, write documentation, support the engineering team in testing)
- Sales and Marketing Team (3 members)
- Office Manager (1; manages day-to-day administrative tasks, including finance-related activities, procurement, and facilities management)

## Current Challenges

1. *Stability Issues:* The newly inducted team, although competent, struggled with the diverse technological landscape. Understanding the nuanced interactions between microservices, each built using different technologies and state management systems, was a formidable challenge. This resulted in numerous service outages.

2. *Stifled Innovation:* Earlier, *SmartHomeTech*'s hallmark was its consistent innovation. But the current team, grappling with the intricacies of the complex system, has been more reactive than proactive, leading to a diminished pace of innovation.

3. *Deployment Difficulties:* Even with the power of Kubernetes, deployments became nightmarish. Due to the delicate interplay of services and the blend of technologies, each deployment became a high-risk operation, often leading to unintended disruptions in unrelated services.
